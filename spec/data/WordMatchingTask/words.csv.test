It became Britain's leading magazine for humorous political and social comment, and included drawings by famous artists such as John Tenniel. It was originally published every week. In the 1980s it began losing readers to other magazines such as Private Eye, and a common joke was that it was only read in dentist's waiting rooms. It stopped appearing in 1992 but appeared again from 1996 to 2002.","What will revive him?","Punch to the face.","Run!","vcqlLyXKUmOufZTwjJhxQsdtREIFVGbNkrSnMPapCzBDWYAgio.mp4","Удар в лицо.","punch -  <br> punches -  <br> punched -  <br> punching -  <br> punch -  <br> ","[sound:vcqlLyXKUmOufZTwjJhxQsdtREIFVGbNkrSnMPapCzBDWYAgio.mp4]","This is Michael.","I once punched him in the face, because I thought he was a ghost.","Bob, how do you know Michael?","liPxYcXUOHGykbRjhfMWZvKSqQCNIDJtronmpALwaTBuEegVdF.mp4","","punch -  <br> punches -  <br> punched -  <br> punching -  <br> punch -  <br> ","[sound:liPxYcXUOHGykbRjhfMWZvKSqQCNIDJtronmpALwaTBuEegVdF.mp4]","But no, there was definitely this thing where Richard punched you,","so you punched me and I punched Jimmy.","And it became...","fNDUgxdHMGscyiJKSqwlRkQjFBVeZomhTWXaPAIruCpnOEYzLv.mp4","","punch -  <br> punches -  <br> punched -  <br> punching -  <br> punch -  <br> ","[sound:fNDUgxdHMGscyiJKSqwlRkQjFBVeZomhTWXaPAIruCpnOEYzLv.mp4]","3","((punched|punches|punch))|(punch)","171227"
